# I can do **MarkDown**

### personal usage of markdown

If you want to see i have done some markdown with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) where i manage a grimoire of spells from DnD because why not [My Grimoire](https://github.com/Guillaume-dubrulle/Grimoire_D-D.git)

### more profesional usage

in school i make documentation of code with markdown so i can like talk about some part of code i do like this
```c
int main(void)
{
  char *my_name = "Guillaume";

  printf("my name is :", my_name);
  return 1;
}
```
